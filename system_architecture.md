# System Architecture Document

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture of the AI-powered research assistant system, which consists of a backend service for data processing and embedding, and a frontend interface for user interaction.

## Backend Architecture

### 1. Core Components

#### 1.1 Data Processing Layer

- **PDF Processing**
  - Handles PDF document ingestion
  - Extracts text content from PDFs
  - Processes and cleans extracted text
  - Location: `Backend/pdfs/`

#### 1.2 Vector Store Layer

- **Embedding Generation**
  - Converts text into vector embeddings
  - Uses advanced language models for semantic understanding
  - Location: `Backend/vectorstore/`

#### 1.3 Query Processing Layer

- **Query Handler** (`queryHandler.js`)
  - Processes user queries
  - Implements semantic search functionality
  - Manages context and conversation history
  - Handles API endpoints for query processing

#### 1.4 Prompt Management

- **Prompt System** (`prompts.py`)
  - Manages system prompts and templates
  - Handles prompt engineering and optimization
  - Controls conversation flow and context

### 2. Data Flow

1. PDF documents are ingested and processed
2. Text is extracted and cleaned
3. Content is converted into vector embeddings
4. Embeddings are stored in vector database
5. User queries are processed through semantic search
6. Results are returned to frontend

### 3. Dependencies

- Node.js runtime
- Python environment
- Vector database (Pinecone)
- PDF processing libraries
- Language model integration

## Frontend Architecture
