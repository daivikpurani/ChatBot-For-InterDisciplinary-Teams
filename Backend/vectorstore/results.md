DeepSeek is a reinforcement learning (RL) approach designed to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). 
The main idea behind DeepSeek is to utilize RL with human-friendly cold-start data, allowing for efficient training of LLMs that can
exhibit strong reasoning behaviors.

To achieve this, DeepSeek incorporates a multi-stage training pipeline. First, it collects thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune
the base model, followed by a reasoning-oriented RL process similar to DeepSeek-R1-Zero. After convergence in the RL process, 
rejection sampling and supervised fine-tuning are performed using additional data from related domains. The resulting checkpoint, 
referred to as DeepSeek-R1, achieves performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217.

One of the key benefits of DeepSeek is its ability to address challenges such as poor readability and language mixing, which were 
encountered by previous models like DeepSeek-R1-Zero. To overcome these issues, DeepSeek incorporates a multi-stage training 
pipeline that includes fine-tuning with cold-start data and supervised learning from related domains.

As shown in Table 5, distilling the outputs of DeepSeek-R1 enables smaller dense models to outperform non-reasoning models across 
various reasoning-related benchmarks. This suggests that DeepSeek has been successfully applied to improve the reasoning 
capabilities of LLMs.

Overall, DeepSeek represents an innovative approach to enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models through 
reinforcement learning with human-friendly cold-start data.

Drawback of DeepSeek-R1-Zero Although DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits strong reasoning
capabilities and autonomously develops unexpected and powerful reasoning behaviors, it faces
several issues. For instance, DeepSeek-R1-Zero struggles with challenges like poor readability,
and language mixing. To make reasoning processes more readable and share them with the
open community, we explore DeepSeek-R1, a method that utilizes RL with human-friendly
cold-start data.
2.3. DeepSeek-R1: Reinforcement Learning with Cold Start
Inspired by the promising results of DeepSeek-R1-Zero, two natural questions arise: 1) Can
reasoning performance be further improved or convergence accelerated by incorporating a small
amount of high-quality data as a cold start? 2) How can we train a user-friendly model that
not only produces clear and coherent Chains of Thought (CoT) but also demonstrates strong

DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates a small amount of cold-start data and a multi-stage training
pipeline. Specifically, we begin by collecting thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the
DeepSeek-V3-Base model. Following this, we perform reasoning-oriented RL like DeepSeek-R1-
Zero. Upon nearing convergence in the RL process, we create new SFT data through rejection
sampling on the RL checkpoint, combined with supervised data from DeepSeek-V3 in domains
such as writing, factual QA, and self-cognition, and then retrain the DeepSeek-V3-Base model.
After fine-tuning with the new data, the checkpoint undergoes an additional RL process, taking
into account prompts from all scenarios. After these steps, we obtained a checkpoint referred to
as DeepSeek-R1, which achieves performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217.
We further explore distillation from DeepSeek-R1 to smaller dense models. Using Qwen2.5-

Abstract
We introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1.
DeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without super-
vised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrates remarkable reasoning capabilities.
Through RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerges with numerous powerful and intriguing
reasoning behaviors. However, it encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language
mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce
DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates multi-stage training and cold-start data before RL. DeepSeek-
R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on reasoning tasks. To support the
research community, we open-source DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models
