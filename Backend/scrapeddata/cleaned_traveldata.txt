Thanks so much to Bay Area Telegraph for sharing the news that a massive European-style Food Hall is hopefully coming to the East Bay.
After seven years of anticipation, Walnut Creek has officially given the green light for The Foundry, a sprawling 24,000-square-foot European-style food hall in the heart of downtown. Initially proposed in 2018, the project has faced delays and revisions, but with city approval now secured, the ambitious development is finally moving forward.
The Foundry is expected to be a culinary and social hub, featuring a mix of specialty food vendors, restaurants, and possibly a brewery and wine bar in additional buildings set around the courtyard. While exact details remain under wraps, early renderings suggest a concept similar to Eataly, the popular Italian food hall with locations in San Jose and other major cities. Visitors can likely expect an expansive selection of international cuisine, fresh market goods, and artisanal beverages.
The development will be located on the vacant lot across from the Walnut Creek movie theater at 1250 Locust Street / 1501 Mount Diablo Boulevard. The two-story structure will also include an outdoor courtyard and additional buildings to complement the main hall. Plans indicate that the outdoor area could host live music, events, and communal dining, making it a potential hotspot for locals and visitors alike.
While securing city approval marks a major milestone, the project still has hurdles to clear, including obtaining necessary permits and finalizing construction plans. If all goes smoothly, The Foundry could bring a vibrant new energy to Walnut Creek’s dining and entertainment scene.
For Bay Area food lovers, this is an exciting development worth watching. Whether it’s enjoying a freshly baked pastry, sipping on a fine glass of wine, or discovering a new favorite dish, The Foundry promises to be a culinary destination that transforms downtown Walnut Creek into a must-visit food and social experience.

Critically-acclaimed playwright James Ijames reinvents Shakespeare’s masterpiece with his new drama, Fat Ham. Juicy is a queer, Southern college kid, already grappling with some serious questions of identity, when the ghost of his father shows up in their backyard, demanding that Juicy avenge his murder. It feels like a familiar story to Juicy, well-versed in Hamlet’s woes. What’s different is Juicy himself, a sensitive and self-aware young Black man trying to break the cycles of trauma and violence in service of his own liberation. From an uproarious family barbecue emerges a compelling examination of love and loss, pain and joy. Winner of the 2022 Pulitzer Prize for Drama.

Thanks to SFist for sharing the news the reopening of the Castro Theatre has been delayed due to an ongoing issue with PG&E power access. Initially planned for summer 2025, with hopes of being open for Pride Month, the theater is now expected to open at the earliest in fall 2025.
The delay is tied to the installation of new lighting and sound systems, which require an upgraded power source. PG&E’s timeline for providing this service remains uncertain, leaving the project in a holding pattern. Another Planet Entertainment, which is managing the renovation, has indicated that while there are multiple options for securing power, the process remains outside their control.
The delay impacts not only the theater but also local businesses that had anticipated an economic boost from increased foot traffic. The Castro Theatre has historically hosted major events, including portions of the Frameline film festival, which last took place at the venue in 2023.
In addition to the theater’s delay, nearby businesses in the Castro Theatre building are also facing uncertainty. Castro Coffee Company and an adjacent nail salon remain in negotiations with the building’s landlord, the Nasser family, over lease renewals. The outcome of these negotiations could affect the stability of businesses that contribute to the neighborhood’s daytime economy.
Local business leaders have emphasized the importance of maintaining the area’s vibrancy and hope for a resolution that supports both tenants and the surrounding community. While the theater’s next possible opening window falls between late 2025 and early 2026, the ultimate timeline remains dependent on power upgrades and construction progress.
In addition, SF Gate has noted that the renovations are expected to cost more than double its initial budget of $15 million. Another Planet Entertainment projects that the renovations will likely cost in excess of $35 million which include a new HVAC system, a projector, a new film screen, a newer, larger organ, plus the electrical upgrades.

Illuminate and SF Rec and Park to kick off 5th Season of Free Live Music at the Golden Gate Bandshell on March 1, 2025 with more than 125 performances are planned to celebrate the Bandshell’s 125th anniversary.
Illuminate and the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department will present more than 125 free concerts at the historic Golden Gate Bandshell in Golden Gate Park in 2025, starting with women-fronted bands on March 1. The 2025 season will run through mid-November, featuring shows most Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays, and select Saturdays.
Over the past four years, the Bandshell has become a hub for diverse musical genres and legendary performances, including Kronos Quartet’s 50th Anniversary, Victor Wooten, Pato Banton, DJs like Doc Martin and Justin Martin, annual events like Surf Fest, Children’s Day, and St. Patrick’s Day with Shana Morrison, and weekly reggae celebration Crucial Reggae Sundays. In total, more than 600 free shows have been held as part of the series, called Illuminate LIVE, attracting nearly 1 million music lovers to the park’s Music Concourse.
The Bandshell, renovated by Illuminate in 2020 with world-class sound and lighting systems, continues to be the center of independent music in one of America’s premier parks, with over 23 million annual visits.
Season Five of Illuminate’s free music series continues a tradition of rich history at the historic Bandshell.  Nestled in Golden Gate Park, the Bandshell stands as a grand neoclassical stage for San Francisco’s public musical life. The structure was a gift from Claus Spreckels, a sugar magnate, to the City in 1900, meant to inspire and elevate civic culture through free outdoor concerts.
The Opening Concert will also feature a tribute to Paul McCartney, a nod to the new exhibit “Paul McCartney Photographs 1963–64: Eyes of the Storm,” which will be on display at San Francisco’s de Young Museum from March 1 through July 6.
Illuminate LIVE 2025 Season Details:
The 2025 full schedule will be updated regularly, including special events.
Noon – 12:15pm: Welcome Remarks
Phil Ginsburg, SF Rec & Park GM, Kat Anderson, President of the Rec/Park Commission, and Ben Davis, Founder of Illuminate. Mayor Lurie has also been invited.
The full lineup of performers is as diverse and local as it was in its first four seasons. The 2025 concerts will feature R&B, soul, jazz, funk, big bands, string ensembles, punk, indie and psychedelic rock bands, and many singer-songwriters. In addition, the series will include lots of reggae, Latin, and EDM.
The Illuminate LIVE free concert series was initially launched as part of Golden Gate Park’s 150th anniversary in 2020, a yearlong celebration put on by the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department. The Illuminate Live series is funded through private support and grants.
Catch live music in the park every Wednesday, Friday and Sunday (plus select Saturdays) through November.

San Francisco’s only Cat Cafe hosts their mew Purrlates class in their cat lounge with 20+ cats on select Wednesday and Friday evenings. Each class lasts around 30-40 minutes, giving you time to mingle with cats, sip on a glass of sparkling wine (Friday nights only), or shop in our cat centric gift shop for the remainder of the hour.
Cats on Mats: Purrlates
We recommend you wear a tee shirt or long sleeve shirt, as many of our cats like to hop on backs during these sessions (it can be a little unpurrdictable). We also advise that you show up ready to go in your purrlates workout outfit, as we only have one restroom for changing and to bring a water bottle just in case you get parched during your session. *It is optional to bring your own mat, but we will be providing clean pilates mats as well.
About KitTea Cat Lounge & Cafe
We like to think of a visit in our Cat Lounge as spa-like; a massage without the massage (unless you get Tippi on your lap). The process is akin to buying a ticket for a concert, but the band is 20-ish cats and the singing is much better than you’d expect.

Getting to KitTea
About Your Teacher: Robin discovered pilates in 2011, a few years after being hit by a car. Not only did she find it to be the most effective physical rehabilitation for her injuries, it also dramatically improved her overall well being. Her teaching promotes internally-focused movement while de-emphasizing aesthetics. She understands that movement is not one-size-fits-all and strives to help her students discover what works best for their unique bodies.
In addition to being KitTea’s mew purrlates teacher, she also teaches down the street at EHS (without cats). There you can challenge yourself on one of their many reformers.
When she’s not teaching she can be found selling property and riding bikes around San Francisco and Marin, or trapped under a very opinionated 9-year old tuxie.

Embarcadero Waterfront Park Revitalization Moves Forward
San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors has approved a plan to revamp Embarcadero Plaza and the adjacent Sue Bierman Park as part of ongoing efforts to boost Downtown’s public spaces. The project is a collaboration between the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department, Office of Economic and Workforce Development, real estate developer BXP, and the Downtown SF Partnership.
The redevelopment will merge Embarcadero Plaza, South Embarcadero, and Sue Bierman Park into a single 5-acre park — double the size of Union Square. The new design, led by architecture firm HOK, will replace the current concrete layout with lush green spaces, walking paths, and recreational areas. Plans include sculpture gardens, food trucks, volleyball courts, picnic spots, and a bandshell stage for live performances.
BXP will contribute approximately $2.5 million toward the design, while city agencies will seek public and private funding to cover the remainder of the estimated $25-$30 million cost.
Community feedback will play a key role in shaping the park’s final design. The first public meeting will take place on Thursday, March 6, 2025 from 5 to 7 p.m. at 4 Embarcadero Center.
The project aims to create a more inviting space along San Francisco’s waterfront, supporting the city’s broader Downtown revitalization efforts.
Over the past year, the City has invested significant effort into reinvigorating Embarcadero Plaza.

Once a week, in the late hours of what used to be “not considered late,” a group of degenerates and misfits gather to perform a seance unlike anything seen before. So comically evil that you may get sick to your stomach. The Ritual will be improvised, gut wrenchingly funny, with a tinge of fuckery.
While you can just sit there and enjoy the show, you are welcome to participate should you so choose. Volunteers and volunteers only!!! Five times during the show, the performers will draw at random topic. If you have a fun, embarrassing, awkward, or cringeworthy story relating to the topic pulled, PRAY DO TELL!!! Your story is a sacrifice to the underworld and one of the five-suggestions needed to complete the pentagram.
“The Ritual” Comedy Show
– Less than two blocks from 24th Street BART
Have a drink during the show or come early to hangout. We serve beer, wine, and pre-mixed cocktails. As we do not have a kitchen, our food is limited to pre-packaged snacks. You are welcome to eat outside food in our lobby. Only our concessions are allowed to be consumed in the theater.

Heartfelt l Magical l Witty
When the process of grieving his mother involves an overly enthusiastic funeral director, and a demanding Aunt Glo, there’s nowhere for Gil to turn but a wild grab-an-urn-and-go roadtrip to find his fairytale ending. From the mind of Colman Domingo comes a wondrous dramedy about the sometimes bizarre and often inexplicable bonds of family.
“Absurdly amusing farce” – Variety
“Big-hearted semi-autobiographical dramedy” – Entertainment Weekly
“Sweet, funny and forgivably sentimental” – The New York Times
“You will be jumping out of your seat with unalloyed laughter” – Stage & Cinema
“Wonderfully joyous, sweet and funny adventure” – Broadway World
“Touching, ridiculous, and strangely satisfying” – Theatremania
Colman Domingo (Playwright, pronouns: he/him) is a Tony®, Oscar, Sir Lawrence Olivier, Drama Desk, Drama League and NAACP Theatre Award nominated, OBIE, and Lucille Lortel Award winning actor, playwright, director and producer. His plays include A Boy and His Soul, Up Jumped Springtime, and The Brothers, and he has co-written two musicals: SUMMER: The Donna Summer Musical, and Lights Out: Nat “King” Cole. Colman received his Honorary Doctorate in Humane Letters from Ursinus College. He is on the faculty of University of Southern California School of Dramatic Arts as a Professor of acting, having served as a Juilliard School Creative Associate and a faculty member of the Yale School of Drama.

ShawnJ West (Director, pronouns: he/him/diva) is a director/actor whose credits are many! Acting since high school and directing since 2008, with directing being his greatest joy. Directing the we are continuous West Coast regional premiere at NCTC in 2023 is a career highlight, and returning to the stage tapping his heart out in Unpacking in P’town was joyous. Now he just wishes people get his name right: ShawnJ, one word, no space, period or middle initial. Thanks ever so!

Illuminate and SF Rec and Park to kick off 5th Season of Free Live Music at the Golden Gate Bandshell on March 1, 2025 with more than 125 performances are planned to celebrate the Bandshell’s 125th anniversary.
Illuminate and the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department will present more than 125 free concerts at the historic Golden Gate Bandshell in Golden Gate Park in 2025, starting with women-fronted bands on March 1. The 2025 season will run through mid-November, featuring shows most Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays, and select Saturdays.
Over the past four years, the Bandshell has become a hub for diverse musical genres and legendary performances, including Kronos Quartet’s 50th Anniversary, Victor Wooten, Pato Banton, DJs like Doc Martin and Justin Martin, annual events like Surf Fest, Children’s Day, and St. Patrick’s Day with Shana Morrison, and weekly reggae celebration Crucial Reggae Sundays. In total, more than 600 free shows have been held as part of the series, called Illuminate LIVE, attracting nearly 1 million music lovers to the park’s Music Concourse.
The Bandshell, renovated by Illuminate in 2020 with world-class sound and lighting systems, continues to be the center of independent music in one of America’s premier parks, with over 23 million annual visits.
Season Five of Illuminate’s free music series continues a tradition of rich history at the historic Bandshell.  Nestled in Golden Gate Park, the Bandshell stands as a grand neoclassical stage for San Francisco’s public musical life. The structure was a gift from Claus Spreckels, a sugar magnate, to the City in 1900, meant to inspire and elevate civic culture through free outdoor concerts.
The Opening Concert will also feature a tribute to Paul McCartney, a nod to the new exhibit “Paul McCartney Photographs 1963–64: Eyes of the Storm,” which will be on display at San Francisco’s de Young Museum from March 1 through July 6.
Illuminate LIVE 2025 Season Details:
The 2025 full schedule will be updated regularly, including special events.
Noon – 12:15pm: Welcome Remarks
Phil Ginsburg, SF Rec & Park GM, Kat Anderson, President of the Rec/Park Commission, and Ben Davis, Founder of Illuminate. Mayor Lurie has also been invited.
The full lineup of performers is as diverse and local as it was in its first four seasons. The 2025 concerts will feature R&B, soul, jazz, funk, big bands, string ensembles, punk, indie and psychedelic rock bands, and many singer-songwriters. In addition, the series will include lots of reggae, Latin, and EDM.
The Illuminate LIVE free concert series was initially launched as part of Golden Gate Park’s 150th anniversary in 2020, a yearlong celebration put on by the San Francisco Recreation and Park Department. The Illuminate Live series is funded through private support and grants.
Catch live music in the park every Wednesday, Friday and Sunday (plus select Saturdays) through November.

It is Funcheap’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
Like most website operators, Funcheap collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Funcheap’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Funcheap’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Funcheap may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Funcheap also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments and entering contests. Funcheap only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
Certain visitors to Funcheap choose to interact with Funcheap in ways that require Funcheap to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Funcheap gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Funcheap does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Funcheap may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Funcheap may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Funcheap does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
Funcheap discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it for business purposes on Funcheap’s behalf or to provide services available at Funcheap’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Funcheap’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Funcheap discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Funcheap believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Funcheap, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Funcheap website or email list and have supplied your email address, Funcheap may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Funcheap and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Funcheap takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
How your information may be shared
Funcheap will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone, unless the user has opted in to have their information shared. For example, if you enter a contest and choose to receive notifications about the results of the contest, we may provide your information to the promoter of the contest for the purpose of them notifying you of the results and in some cases to be signed up for their email list as determined through an opt/in out tick box on the page where you entered the contest. If you have opted in to receive information from one of our partners, we will do our best to ensure that they provide a clear and easy way to unsubscribe, but cannot be held liable for ways that their privacy policy differs from that of Funcheap. In addition, if you win a contest, we may provide your contact information to the promoter for the purposes of arranging the prize to be delivered to you or picked up. Funcheap also periodically will allow third party companies sponsor dedicated emails to our email list, however the emails are sent directly from Funcheap and your personal information is not shared with the third party except in the case where you have opted in to have your information shared. These third party companies who sponsor contests and content on Funcheap have their own respective privacy policies if you choose to provide them with your information on the third party website.
Funcheap takes your privacy very seriously. We do not sell your personal information. The only time your information may be transferred to a third party would be in the case where you purchased or booked tickets and we needed to provide limited information in order to facilitate the purchase, or if you won tickets/prize as part of a sweepstakes and we needed to provide limited information in order to facilitate the winner(s) to be chosen and for the tickets/prize to be fulfilled. In rare occasions, a third party will run a sweepstakes form on Funcheap and will collect entries, but this is only in cases if it is clearly denoted that the sweepstakes information is being shared with the third party.
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Funcheap uses cookies to help Funcheap identify and track visitors, their usage of Funcheap website, and their website access preferences. Funcheap visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Funcheap’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Funcheap’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
If Funcheap, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Funcheap goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Funcheap may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy and that there may be changes to the policy

About the Sisters
The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence is a leading-edge Order of queer and trans nuns who believe all people have a right to express their unique joy and beauty. Since their first appearance in San Francisco on Easter Sunday, 1979, the Sisters have devoted themselves to community service, ministry, and outreach to those on the edges and to promoting human rights, respect for diversity, and spiritual enlightenment. The Sisters use humor and irreverent wit to expose the forces of bigotry, complacency, and guilt that chain the human spirit. To learn more about the Sisters, visit their website, www.thesisters.org, or their Facebook and Instagram pages.

Thanks to San Francisco Examiner for sharing the details that San Francisco’s Embarcadero Plaza will soon be home to “R-Evolution,” a 45-foot-tall sculpture by Marco Cochrane that was originally planned for Union Square. City officials relocated the installation after concerns that its weight could damage Union Square’s granite tiles.
“R-Evolution” is part of Cochrane’s triptych honoring female empowerment and was first displayed at Burning Man in 2015. The towering steel structure features geodesic panels and stainless steel mesh, with movable components and LED lighting designed to simulate breathing. The sculpture weighs 16,000 pounds, with an additional 16,000 pounds of steel anchoring plates.
The sculpture was initially set for Union Square, where officials hoped it would help revitalize the area following economic downturns. However, just days before its scheduled assembly, concerns arose about potential damage to the plaza’s tiles and underground garage structure, prompting a search for a new location. After further engineering reviews, the San Francisco Arts Commission and the Recreation and Park Department approved Embarcadero Plaza as the new site.
A public unveiling event is expected to accompany the installation. While details are still being finalized, event organizers plan to include local artists in the celebration, particularly those who typically sell their wares in the plaza. The sculpture will be installed for at least six months, with the possibility of an extension.
With its prominent location near the Ferry Building, R-Evolution is poised to become a new focal point along the Embarcadero, drawing visitors and helping breathe new life into San Francisco’s downtown arts scene.

Free 72-Hour Pass to NY Times Online

Reliable news is hard to find these days. The Chronicle and SFGate are great, but The New York Times does an excellent job of coverage should you want a more national perspective.
Although they often have promotions for $1/week access for the first six months, The New York Times’ regular rate is $6.25 a week for online access (ouch!). But here’s how you can get legal access for free, if you don’t mind a few clicks and if you have a library card.
The San Francisco Public Library provides free online access to The New York Times for up to 72-hours with a code – you can renew this as many times as you like. Yes, it’s a little bit of a pain to have to get a new code every 3 days, but that’s the price you pay for free. This works for both the website or the mobile app. Get more info
Please note that periodically the codes don’t work and the system is taken down for a few days with no explanation.
How to get a free NY Times 72-Hour Pass
What happens after 72 hours? After the first 72 hours have passed, you will need to redeem another code for another 72 hours of remote access (i.e. Repeat Step 2). This is the licensing model that New York Times has negotiated with public libraries.
What do you get?
What’s excluded? Your code will give you free Basic Digital access to The New York Times with no commitment required. While the library subscription includes access to many areas of New York Times Digital, there may be some features and sections reserved for individual subscribers. We think that this excludes the Cooking section and the Crossword.

The robot revolution is upon us, and they’ve infiltrated the world of comedy! Join us for “Laugh GPT,” the AI-powered comedy show that might just be humanity’s last stand-up hurrah.
Laugh GPT was recently featured in the Washington Post!
As artificial intelligence advances, who knows how long our human comedians will be able to hold their ground?
At this unique event, our talented professional comedians have bravely enlisted the help of a joke-cracking AI to deliver an unforgettable night of laughter.
They’ve trained the AI to mimic their styles, and they’re challenging you to tell which of their closing jokes were crafted by the comedians or by the machines. Can you save humanity by telling them apart?
Whether you’re an AI buff, a comedy aficionado, or just curious to see if robots can really make you laugh, “Laugh GPT” promises a night of hilarity and intrigue.
Join us for this potentially historic event and be part of the moment when humans and AI join forces on stage. Or the moment where it all ends for humanity.

Thursday marks the final day for vehicles on San Francisco’s Upper Great Highway as the city moves forward with its plan to convert the roadway into a park. Approved by voters through Proposition K in the November election, the decision reflects a shift toward prioritizing public recreational spaces over car traffic.
While a lawsuit challenging the validity of the vote is still pending, city officials are proceeding with the transformation. The suit argues that such decisions should be made by local government officials rather than voters, but for now, the plan to close the road remains in place.
The upcoming 2-mile-long, 43-acre park is expected to open on April 12 and will feature various amenities, including art installations, lounge spaces, event seating, skating areas, bike racks, outdoor fitness equipment, and a nature exploration area. The San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department is also engaging the public in a naming contest for the new park, with submissions accepted until Sunday, March 16, at 5 p.m.
The decision to close the Upper Great Highway to traffic has been met with mixed reactions. Supporters see the change as a significant step toward expanding public green spaces and enhancing recreational opportunities. However, many west-side residents opposed the closure, citing concerns about increased traffic congestion in surrounding neighborhoods. Data from Election Map SF indicates that about 15,000 vehicles traveled the highway daily, leading critics to worry about the impact on already busy streets nearby.
Despite opposition, city officials are committed to moving forward with the park’s development. The transformation of the Upper Great Highway marks a major shift in how San Francisco prioritizes urban space, aiming to provide more areas for outdoor activities while addressing long-term environmental and community needs.

The Woman in the Yard
A Working Man
The Amateur
A lone, spectral woman shrouded entirely in black appears on a family’s front lawn without explanation and warns them “today’s the day.” Where did she come from? What does she want? When will she leave? Only The Woman in the Yard knows. From Blumhouse, the most successful global brand in horror, comes a new original chiller starring BAFTA and SAG nominee Danielle Deadwyler (Till, The Harder They Fall, The Piano Lesson) as Ramona, a woman crippled by grief after she survives a car accident that takes her husband (Russell Hornsby; BMF, Fences). Seriously injured, Ramona now must care for their 14-year-old son (Peyton Jackson; Respect, American Refugee) and 6-year-old-daughter (Estella Kahiha; Will Trent, BMF), alone in her rural farmhouse. Then one day the woman takes form in their yard. Ramona assumes the woman (Okwui Okpokwasili; The Exorcist: Believer, Julie Taymor’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream) is lost or demented, but as the woman creeps nearer and nearer to the house, it becomes clear she is no ordinary figure and her intentions are anything but peaceful. Now Ramona must rally to protect herself and her children from the grasp of the woman who simply won’t leave them alone. The Woman in the Yard is directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (Black Adam, Jungle Cruise), who recently directed Deadwyler in the upcoming action thriller Carry On. The film is written by first-time feature screenwriter Sam Stefanak.
Levon Cade left behind a decorated military career in the black ops to live a simple life working construction. But when his boss’s daughter, who is like family to him, is taken by human traffickers, his search to bring her home uncovers a world of corruption far greater than he ever could have imagined.
“The Amateur,” an action-packed espionage-thriller from 20th Century Studios starring Oscar® winner Rami Malek (“Bohemian Rhapsody”), opens in theaters nationwide April 11, 2025. Charlie Heller (Malek) is a brilliant, but deeply introverted decoder for the CIA working out of a basement office at headquarters in Langley whose life is turned upside down when his wife is killed in a London terrorist attack. When his supervisors refuse to take action, he takes matters into his own hands, embarking on a dangerous trek across the globe to track down those responsible, his intelligence serving as the ultimate weapon for eluding his pursuers and achieving his revenge. The film also stars Rachel Brosnahan, Caitríona Balfe, Jon Bernthal, Michael Stuhlbarg, Holt McCallany, Julianne Nicholson, Adrian Martinez, Danny Sapani, and Laurence Fishburne. “The Amateur” is directed by James Hawes. The screenplay is by Ken Nolan and Gary Spinelli based on the novel by Robert Littell. The film is produced by Hutch Parker, p.g.a., Dan Wilson, p.g.a., Rami Malek, Joel B. Michaels, with JJ Hook serving as executive producer.
